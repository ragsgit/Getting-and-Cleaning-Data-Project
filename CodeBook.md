# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project
# November, 2017

This code book (`CoodBook.md`) is for the data in tidy_data.txt available in this repo. The data file was created by running `run_analysis.R`.

The `README.md` file in this repo provides background on the data set, and info on the R program used to create this data set.

[Data](#data) section describes the structure of this data set.
[Variables](#variables) lists and describes the variables of the data set.
[Transformations](#transformations) section describes the manipulations/transformation done on the source data to get this data set.


## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables.

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `activity`

	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values:
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing `Accelerometer`) were made in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing `Gyroscope`) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing `Magnitude`) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `FrequencyDomain`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `TimeDomain`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Source data loading, and transformations were done by the R Program in `run_analysis.R` file in this repo.
The following are the transformations applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
1. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings `mean` and `std`) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
1. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see [Identifiers](#identifiers) section).
1. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` was expanded to `TimeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX`), using the following set of rules:
	- Special characters (i.e. `(`, `)`, and `-`) were removed
	- The initial `f` and `t` were expanded to `FrequencyDomain` and `TimeDomain` respectively.
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` were replaced with `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
	- Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's `features_info.txt` file) `BodyBody` with `Body`.
1. From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
